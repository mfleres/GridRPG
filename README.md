# GridRPG
GridRPG (name pending) is a strategy RPG that tries to emulate and heavily streamline tabletop gaming such as D&D. It is similar to Fire Emblem but with fewer controllable units that each have more gameplay depth. Players control up to a maximum of 5 units and must complete map objectives. Player units have experience progression, and earn skills. Further details will be worked out further into development.

The code is mostly run through Unity C# scripts, using minimal use of the Unity Editor. Game elements are stored in XML format and are parsed run-time. This allows flexibility and expandability.

# Controls
When viewing a map, click on a unit to select them. Then click on another space. If possible, the unit will move there. Clicking another unit will switch the selected unit.
